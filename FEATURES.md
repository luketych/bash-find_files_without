Set configuration options so I can easily change them. For example, default depth.

Then I can also make shorthand commands with specific set defaults, and can turn one master
commands into a few smaller ones for different purposes. For example, I can modify this
program to have a version that is really good at exploring a project, starting at a depth
of 1 and then opening things up into depth 2, etc with less and less types of files.
This would be a fun way to explore directories.

I could have another version that is better at just giving me different summaries of file types
and help me get a break down of all of the big files in a dir and subdirs, as a dumb example.
